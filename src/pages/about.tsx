              Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm a tech and travel enthusiast living in Chicago.
            </h1>
              <p>
                I grew up in a small town in Illinois dreaming of travel,
                and I consider myself lucky to have done at least little bit of that
                as a flight attendant, English teacher in South Korea, and backpacker. 
                While I wouldn't change a thing,
                nearly a decade in the air coupled with the pandemic left me thinking about 
                new challenges, old passions, and where I wanted to land next in my career.
                I had always been interested in technology and worked in desktop support during my time in college,
                so I decided to revisit the field and update my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p> 
                I currently hold three CompTIA certifications and a CCNA through self-study 
                and learned to code with JavaScript
                through The Odin Project, an open source, project-based learning course and community. 
                Professionally, I now get to do IT support for a public organization
                that does work I believe in. At the moment I am focusing
                on learning Powershell and Azure and tinkering in my virtualization server and home lab. 
              </p>
              
              <p> 
                When I'm not coding or studying, I like spending time running mid to long
                distances, playing the occasional video game, listening to podcasts, or reading fantasy or
                nonfiction. I also meditate daily, am a vegetarian, and consider myself a pretty calm, kind person who 
                tries to find the fun in life. 
                Thanks for passing through, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to work together. :)
